#We are exploring whether there is a relationship between nfl team success and city population
# Research question 1: Is there a relationship between city population and regular season record
# Research question 2: Is there a relationship between stadium attendance and regular season record


# Collect data from related sources - using rvest package
# - NFL website (Season Records)
# - US Census (City Populations)
# - ESPN (Stadium Attendance 2007 - current)
#read in data, wrangle the data, tidy the data
#data in tidy format should have each case as a team in a given year and the variables will be city population and average percentage of stadium attendance for 
#that given year.


#create graphical representations of variables in question for exploratory data analysis
#exploratory data will plot each team with the x-axis being the population/ % of stadium attendance and the y-axis will be the teams winning percentage.
#We will then comment on our observations(any visible trends in the data, outliers, etc.)

#create regression models for each research question


#create graphical representations of the data that support our results from regression models


#create written report stating our final conclusions along with supplemental graphs
