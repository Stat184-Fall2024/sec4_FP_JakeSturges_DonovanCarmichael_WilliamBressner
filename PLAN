# Used in our initial Start, but as we progressed individual plans were added to each section that we coded upon
#We are exploring whether there is a relationship between nfl team success and city population
# Research question 1: Is there a relationship between city population and regular season record
# Research question 2: Is there a relationship between stadium attendance and regular season record


# Collect data from related sources - using rvest package
# - NFL website (Season Records)
# - US Census (City Populations)
# - ESPN (Stadium Attendance 2007 - current)
# Goal: Find, Tidy, Clean, Wrangle Data into usable tables
# PLAN
# 1) Load necessary data packages: {rvest}, {tidyverse}
#
# 2) Find the needed website urls for the data
# a] US Census for city population
# b] NFl Website for Season Records 
# c] ESPN for stadium attendance over the last 
#
# 3) Create population table
# a] Read Census data into a table using read_html function
# b] Tidy Data so city is case with attributes of:
#.      population and year
# c] Clean the data to remove all n/a or 0 values
# d] Remove all cities without an NFL team
#
# 4) Create NFL Win Percentage by Year Table
# a] Read the data into a table 
# b] Tidy the data so that each case is a Team with attributes: 
#.      year and win percentage 
# c] Clean any data that does not follow table guidelines
#
# 5) Create Average NFL Stadium Attendance by year table
# a] Read the table into R using read_html
# b] Tidy the table, making each case a team with attributes:
#.      year and average stadium attendance
# c] Clean any n/a or 0 values out of the data set
#data in tidy format should have each case as a team in a given year and the variables will be city population and average percentage of stadium attendance for 
#that given year.


#create graphical representations of variables in question for exploratory data analysis
#exploratory data will plot each team with the x-axis being the population/ % of stadium attendance and the y-axis will be the teams winning percentage.
#We will then comment on our observations(any visible trends in the data, outliers, etc.)

#create regression models for each research question


#create graphical representations of the data that support our results from regression models


#create written report stating our final conclusions along with supplemental graphs
