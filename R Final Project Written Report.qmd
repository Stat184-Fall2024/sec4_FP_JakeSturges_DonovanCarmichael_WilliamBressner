Analysis/Results

To explore our research questions we first must define our null hypothesis. For both questions we are assuming that there is no correlation between attendance and win percentage or population and win percentage, therefore our null hypothesis follows:

$$ H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0 $$

for both attendance and win percentage. Beta 1 represents the slope for the regression line and we will be testing if it is significant with an alpha level of 0.05.

For population vs win percentage we created the following scatter plot:

We chose to make each team a different color to show how each teams city population remained relatively similar in each year from 2010-2019. The line of best fit(in red) has a negative slope which is contrary to what we originally thought the data would show. One thing we would like to point out is the New York teams(in blue on the right side of the above graph) are high leverage points and influence the regression line more than the rest of the data, this is a leading cause for the negative regression line since the New York teams had a below average winning percentage from 2010-2019.

Above is our regression summary statistics for the population vs win percentage data. With a p-value of 0.0543222 greater than our required alpha level of 0.05, we cannot say that the slope of the regression line differs from 0 and it is not a significant predictor of win percentage.

For attendance vs win percentage we created the following scatter plot:

For the above graph we can see a much more visible correlation compared to the population graph. The regression line for stadium attendance vs win percentage(above red line) has a positive slope confirming our original belief that attendance would be correlated with win percentage. The 3 points below 40,000 attendance are the 3 years after the rams moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles and these points decrease the slope of the regression line since they are influential points(extreme in both the x and y direction).

Above is the regression summary statistics for the attendance vs win percentage data. With a p-value of 0.0228683 less than 0.05 we can say that the slope of the regression line is greater than 0 at the 5% significance level and attendance is a significant predictor of win percentage. The attendance slope of 0.000028 can be interpreted as for every increase of a person in attendance per game, there is a 0.000028% increase in a teams predicted win percentage.
