FAIR and CARE Principles
The data we collected is pretty findable, as the data we analyzed from the ESPN website was easily accessible.
The data is found in an appropriate repository. 
The meta data does a fairly good job of using language that we can understand and information we can gain for our data analysis. The data provides data usage licenses and sources on the websites. 
The data ecosystems function in ways that do not harm Indigenous Peoples. The data clearly respects Indigenous people and their rights. 
The data clearly outlines the inclusion and support of indigenous people. 
The data includes the NFL Teamâ€™s name change from the Redskins to the Washington Commanders in 2022. The US Census data from 2010 to 2019 abides by the CARE Principles developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance.
